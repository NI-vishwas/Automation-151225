## 📋 Project Structure

### Core Scripts

#### Calculations
- **`01-simple_interest.py`** - Calculate simple interest with hardcoded values
- **`02-simple_interest.py`** - Interactive simple interest calculator with user input
- **`03-numsum.py`** - Calculate sum and average of 10 numbers from user
- **`04-numsum.py`** - Calculate sum and average of dynamic number of entries (until user enters -999)

#### String & Text Processing
- **`05-username_extracter.py`** - Extract username from email ID (before @ symbol)
- **`06-extract_num.py`** - Extract numbers from a string and calculate their sum
- **`07-extract_punctuations.py`** - Extract and display punctuations from a string
- **`08-summary_generator.py`** - Generate file summaries (lines, words, characters) and save to summary.log

#### Demo/Learning Examples
- **`demo_conditionals.py`** - Demonstrates if, elif, else conditional statements
- **`demo_loops.py`** - Demonstrates while loop with increment/decrement
- **`demo_string.py`** - String manipulation and indexing examples
- **`demo_function1.py`** - Function definitions, parameters, global variables
- **`demo_calsses.py`** - Object-oriented programming with inheritance and method overriding

#### File Handling
- **`file_handling.py`** - File I/O operations with exception handling and context managers
- **`save_data.py`** - Demonstrates importing custom utilities and saving data

## 📁 Data Files

- **`data.txt`** - Sample CSV data (user records with name, id, and salary)
- **`test1.txt`** - Test file for file handling demonstrations
- **`test2.txt`** - Test file for file handling demonstrations

## 🚀 Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

### Running Scripts

**Simple Interest Calculator:**
```bash
python 02-simple_interest.py
```

**Number Sum & Average:**
```bash
python 04-numsum.py
```

**Email Username Extractor:**
```bash
python 05-username_extracter.py
```

**File Summary Generator:**
```bash
python 08-summary_generator.py
```

### Example Runs

**Simple Interest Calculator:**
```
Enter the principal: 2500000
Enter the time in months: 36
Enter the rate of interest: 0.07
The Simple Interest is: 63000.00
```

**Extract Numbers from String:**
```bash
python 06-extract_num.py
# Output: Total: 220
```
